Here’s a Python class that encapsulates the functionality for interacting with Pinecone, including single-row upserts, processing a PDF file page by page, and using AWS storage for bulk imports. This class is designed to be modular and reusable.

Implementation
1 vulnerability
Explanation of the Class
Initialization:

Initializes Pinecone and AWS S3 clients using the provided credentials.
Ensures the specified Pinecone index exists.
Single Row Upsert:

upsert_single_row: Takes a record ID, text, and metadata, generates an embedding, and upserts the data into Pinecone.
PDF Processing:

process_pdf: Reads a PDF file page by page, extracts text, and upserts each page into Pinecone with metadata.
Bulk Import from S3:

bulk_import_from_s3: Uses Pinecone's start_import method to perform a bulk import from an S3 bucket.
Embedding Generation:

_generate_embedding: Placeholder for embedding generation logic. Replace this with your actual embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace).
Example Usage
Single Row Upsert:

Process PDF:

Bulk Import from S3:

Notes
Replace "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY", "YOUR_INDEX_NAME", "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY", "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY", and "YOUR_AWS_REGION" with your actual credentials.
Replace the _generate_embedding method with your actual embedding generation logic.
Ensure the PDF file and S3 bucket paths are correct.

** Pinecone Class for Data Search **

Here’s a Python class for performing semantic search using Pinecone. This class is designed to encapsulate the functionality for querying Pinecone and retrieving context based on semantic similarity.

Implementation
1 vulnerability
Explanation
Initialization:

Initializes Pinecone with the provided API key and ensures the specified index exists.
Raises an error if the index does not exist.
Semantic Search:

search: Takes a query string and performs a semantic search on the Pinecone index.
Generates an embedding for the query using the _generate_embedding method.
Queries the Pinecone index using the query method and retrieves the top-k results.
Formats the results to include the record ID, score, and metadata.
Embedding Generation:

_generate_embedding: Placeholder for generating embeddings. Replace this with your actual embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace).
Example Usage:

Demonstrates how to initialize the class and perform a semantic search.
Example Output
If the Pinecone index contains relevant data, the output might look like this:

Notes
Replace "YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY" and "YOUR_INDEX_NAME" with your actual Pinecone credentials and index name.
Replace the _generate_embedding method with your actual embedding generation logic.
Ensure that the Pinecone index is populated with data before performing a search. You can use the PineconeDataImporter class from the previous implementation to upsert data into the index.
